## ✅ Learning Checklist (Mapped to Pro Git)

This checklist tracks my progress through the **Pro Git (2nd Edition)** book.  
Each item requires **reading + hands-on practice** before being marked complete.

---

### 📖 Chapter 1 – Getting Started

- ✅ What version control is and why it matters
- ✅ Centralized vs Distributed VCS
- ✅ Short history of Git
- ✅ Why Git’s design is different (snapshots, not diffs)
- ✅ Installing Git
- ✅ Basic configuration (`user.name`, `user.email`, editor)

🎯 **Outcome:** Understand *why* Git exists and what problems it solves.

---

### 📖 Chapter 2 – Git Basics (CRITICAL)

- ✅ Initializing a repository (`git init`)
- ✅ File lifecycle (untracked → staged → committed)
- [ ] `git status` and `git diff`
- [ ] Staging files (`git add`)
- [ ] Committing correctly (`git commit`)
- [ ] Viewing history (`git log`, `--oneline`, `--graph`)
- [ ] Undoing mistakes:
  - [ ] `git restore`
  - [ ] `git reset`
  - [ ] `git checkout`
- [ ] Ignoring files (`.gitignore`)
- [ ] Removing and moving files (`git rm`, `git mv`)

🎯 **Outcome:** Daily Git usage without fear.

---

### 📖 Chapter 3 – Git Branching (MOST IMPORTANT)

- [ ] What branches really are (pointers, not copies)
- [ ] Creating and switching branches
- [ ] Fast-forward vs three-way merge
- [ ] Resolving merge conflicts
- [ ] Branch management (`-d`, `-D`)
- [ ] Branching workflows (feature branches)
- [ ] Understanding `HEAD`

🎯 **Outcome:** Full confidence in branching and merging.

---

### 📖 Chapter 4 – Git on the Server

- [ ] Working with remotes
- [ ] `git remote`, `fetch`, `pull`, `push`
- [ ] Tracking branches
- [ ] Push vs pull behavior
- [ ] SSH-based authentication
- [ ] Understanding bare repositories

🎯 **Outcome:** Collaborate safely with remote repositories.

---

### 📖 Chapter 5 – Distributed Git

- [ ] Centralized vs distributed workflows
- [ ] Feature branch workflow
- [ ] Gitflow (understanding, not memorizing)
- [ ] Forking workflow (GitHub-style)
- [ ] Contribution best practices
- [ ] Maintaining a clean history

🎯 **Outcome:** Work professionally in team environments.

---

### 📖 Chapter 6 – GitHub (or Hosting Platforms)

- [ ] Repository hosting concepts
- [ ] Pull requests
- [ ] Code reviews
- [ ] Issues and discussions
- [ ] Forking and syncing upstream
- [ ] Tags and releases

🎯 **Outcome:** Use Git hosting platforms efficiently.

---

### 📖 Chapter 7 – Git Tools (ADVANCED BUT VALUABLE)

- [ ] `git stash` (save work safely)
- [ ] Interactive staging (`git add -p`)
- [ ] Searching history (`git grep`, `git log -S`)
- [ ] Rewriting history (`commit --amend`)
- [ ] Rebase vs merge (when and why)
- [ ] `git reflog` (lifesaver)

🎯 **Outcome:** Recover from mistakes and keep history clean.

---

### 📖 Chapter 8 – Customizing Git

- [ ] Git configuration levels
- [ ] Useful aliases
- [ ] Diff and merge tools
- [ ] Improving personal Git workflow

🎯 **Outcome:** Git tailored to your workflow.

---

### 📖 Chapter 9 – Git Internals (OPTIONAL BUT POWERFUL)

- [ ] Git objects (blob, tree, commit)
- [ ] SHA-1 and content addressing
- [ ] Object storage
- [ ] References and tags
- [ ] How Git really stores history

🎯 **Outcome:** Deep understanding; Git stops feeling “magical”.

---

## 🧭 Progress Tracking Rule

A topic is considered **complete only if**:
- ✔ Read from Pro Git  
- ✔ Practiced in this repository  
- ✔ Understood *why*, not just *how*

---

## 🏁 End Goal

By completing this checklist, I aim to:
- Use Git confidently in production
- Debug broken repositories
- Maintain clean commit history
- Work efficiently in teams and open-source projects
